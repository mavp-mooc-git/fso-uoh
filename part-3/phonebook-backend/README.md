## 3.21 Deploying the database backend to production

Generate a new "full stack" version of the application by creating a new production build of the frontend, and copy it to the backend repository. Verify that everything works locally by using the entire application from the address https://localhost:3001.

Push the latest version to Heroku and verify that everything works there as well.
