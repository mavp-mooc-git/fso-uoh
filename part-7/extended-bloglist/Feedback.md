## Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development

### Full Stack open 2021

In about course page says:

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development
with JavaScript. However, I don't think so because although this course taughts
basic skills trough minimal exercices, this exercices can be abble to give a
clear knowledge about functionalities of the apps created.

This course allows to learn in a clear way each lesson steps and can be the
begining point to more large developments by practicing.

I have enjoyed a lot this course, which has gave me a better understanding
about React apps, node.js server apps and other disciplines.

For my part, thank you very much for this excellent and great course.
